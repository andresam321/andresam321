Hi, I'm Andres Mercado üëã<br>
I‚Äôm a passionate **Software Engineer** with a unique aviation and real estate investing background. My tech journey began in 2022, fueled by a drive to solve inefficiencies and create impactful solutions. Through App Academy, I‚Äôve mastered JavaScript, Python, React, Redux, Flask, PostgreSQL, AWS, and Docker, equipping me to build user-focused applications that streamline operations and deliver results.<br><br>

üöÄ **What I Do:**<br><br>
‚Ä¢ Design and develop full-stack applications that solve real-world problems and enhance user experiences.<br>
‚Ä¢ Craft intuitive user interfaces while streamlining components for optimal performance and maintainability.<br>
‚Ä¢ Optimize database relationships and architecture to ensure seamless data flow and system scalability.<br>
‚Ä¢ Deploy and manage applications using **AWS, Docker, and Nginx** for high availability and scalability.<br><br>

üí° **Current Focus:**<br><br>
Integrating **QR code functionality** into an airport plane management system, allowing users to scan QR codes and auto-fill fuel request forms for faster processing. Continuously refining workflows and improving UI responsiveness to enhance operational efficiency.<br><br>

üìå **Highlighted Projects:**<br><br>

üõ´ Rabbit Aviation (AeroSkyOps) ‚Äì While working as a line service technician at Rabbit Aviation, I identified inefficiencies in how aircraft assignments, fuel requests, and owner information were managed. Recognizing an opportunity to improve operational efficiency, I designed and developed AeroSkyOps, a full-stack aviation management system to replace outdated manual workflows with a dynamic web application, streamlining airport operations.<br><br>

‚úÖ Implemented Features:<br>
‚Ä¢ **FlightAware AeroAPI & Weather API** ‚Äì Provides near-live flight tracking and real-time airport weather conditions.<br>
‚Ä¢ **Fuel Request Management** ‚Äì Developed an interface for employees to submit, track, and manage fuel orders seamlessly.<br>
‚Ä¢ **Fuel Tank Monitoring System** ‚Äì Displays fuel levels with interactive gauges, optimizing fuel management.<br>
‚Ä¢ **Aircraft Parking Assignment & History** ‚Äì Built a system allowing employees to assign, update, and reference past parking assignments.<br>
‚Ä¢ **Owner Linkage System** ‚Äì Links aircraft to their respective owners, ensuring accurate tracking and streamlined management.<br>
‚Ä¢ **Database Optimization** ‚Äì Migrated from MongoDB to PostgreSQL, leveraging SQLAlchemy for structured data handling.<br>
‚Ä¢ **Scalable Deployment** ‚Äì Utilizes Docker for containerization and Nginx for secure, high-availability deployment on AWS EC2.<br>
‚Ä¢ **Image Storage** ‚Äì Uses AWS S3 for secure image storage and retrieval.<br><br>

üõ†Ô∏è Upcoming Enhancements:<br>
‚Ä¢ **QR Code System** ‚Äì Pilots will be able to scan QR codes to quickly access and submit fuel request forms.<br>
‚Ä¢ **Enhanced Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** ‚Äì Implementing user roles for better security and access management.<br><br>

üìö **Break in Between for App Academy:**<br>
‚Ä¢ **App Academy Software Engineering Program (Oct 2023 ‚Äì June 2024)** ‚Äì Completed an intensive 8-month curriculum focused on full-stack development, refining my engineering skills and strengthening my ability to build scalable applications.<br><br>
Over the past two years, I have continuously refined AeroSkyOps, adding new features and improving its architecture to enhance efficiency and modernize airport operations.<be>


üìå **App Academy Project:**<br><br>

**üçΩ Wuber Eats** *(App Academy Project)* ‚Äì A full-stack restaurant ordering platform inspired by Uber Eats. Users can **browse restaurants, add menu items to their cart, and leave reviews**, while restaurant owners can **manage listings, update menus, and receive feedback**. Developed in an **Agile environment**, where I collaborated with a team, participating in **daily sprints, stand-up meetings, and iterative development cycles**. Built with **Flask, PostgreSQL, Redux for state management, and Cloudinary for optimized image handling**. Deployed using **AWS and Docker** to ensure scalability and efficiency.<br><br>

üíº **Previous Experience:**<br><br>
‚Ä¢ **Line Service Technician:** Gained hands-on experience in the aviation industry, ensuring precise fueling operations, adhering to strict safety protocols, and supporting private aircraft logistics.<br>
‚Ä¢ **Real Estate Investor:** Successfully managed a portfolio of properties, overseeing tenant relations, property maintenance, and financial planning to achieve a six-figure income within five years.<br><br>

üë®‚Äçüëß **Personal:**<br><br>
Proud dad who thrives on balancing family time with a passion for coding and continuous learning. Dedicated to staying at the forefront of technology while cherishing meaningful moments with my loved ones.<br><br>
